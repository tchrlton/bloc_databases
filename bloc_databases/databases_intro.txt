A database would be used when you are wanting specific data in an efficient way and also be able to manipulate it as well.
A text file is able to be read by humans and a database uses binary file format which cannot be read by humans but by 
computers which makes it faster for them to find the data.

SQL is a declerative programming language that we can use to find out what we want ourselves instead of how the database
can find it. 

4. 
The pieces of a database system work by having a set of data from a binary text file that the computer uses to be able
to sort through the data as best as possible. The data is pieced together by being in a table with rows and columns and 
the actual values in the table.

A table is the structure of the data in the database that has rows and columns with their values.
A row is usually one data set that pertain to a complete conceptual unit.
A column is what defines what the data represents.
A value is a piece of information from the individual cell of the table.
